# Das Fahrzeug
_The Vehicle / El vehiculo_

## Description
This repository is destined to my `Das Fahrzeug` self-driving vehicle opensource code. You'll find at least 2 approaches for the time being, focused on Machine Learning either Supervised Learning or Reinforcement Learning.

In the near feature the goal is to leverage more than one machine learning approach in order to best achieve a bigger milestone as a fully self-driving vehicle.

## Files
- `/envs` - destined to custom gym environments.
- `/models` - everything trained RL models
